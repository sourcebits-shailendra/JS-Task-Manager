JS-Task-Manager
===============

A simple JS task manager to plan your tasks of the day.
This task manager is a simple tool I built because I needed something to plan my day. This is entirely created with HTML5/CSS/JS, and it uses localStorage to store your tasks.
Simply, just fill in the fields and click add task (or press enter) and your task appears. You have a countdown and the task will change colour when getting near its deadline.
Code is open source, you can do whatever you want with it I don't care.
Also, if you have any feedback or want to mail me or anything, just mail anthony.pigeot[at]gmail.com
Hope it'll be as usefull for you as it is for me.
